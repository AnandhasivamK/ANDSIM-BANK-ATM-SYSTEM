# ANDSIM-BANK-ATM-SYSTEM
This project is a simple implementation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system in C programming language. The system provides basic banking functionalities such as creating bank accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balances.
Overview
The ATM system is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for managing bank accounts. Users can perform various operations conveniently through a text-based menu system. Each account created in the system is associated with a unique account number, card number, and password generated automatically upon creation.

Features
1. Create Bank Account
Users can create a new bank account by providing their name and age.
Upon account creation, a unique account number, card number, and password are generated automatically based on the user's information.
2. Deposit
Account holders can deposit money into their accounts.
The deposited amount is added to the account's existing balance.
3. Withdrawal
Account holders can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
If the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance, an error message is displayed, and the transaction is aborted.
4. Balance Check
Account holders can check their account balance at any time.
The system displays the account holder's name, age, current balance, account number, and card number.
